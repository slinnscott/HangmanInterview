This hangman game is done in the Terminal. 

The Source code is listed under src/hangman, the executable classes are listed under ./hangman. 
All of this code is done in Java, so the commands to run them from the command line will be just Java hangman/Hangman for the executables, or javac ./hangman/Hangman.java

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know. Thanks so much for taking the time to read through this.
